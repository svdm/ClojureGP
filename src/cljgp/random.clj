(defmacro rand-fn
  "Macro that takes a method name and an expression returning a new instance of
  an object, and returns a zero-arg function closing over the object and calling
  the method on it. The method should return a value between 0.0 and 1.0,
  similar to (Math/random).

  Intended usage is for creating gp-rand replacement fns with different PRNGs or
  with user-specified seeds, which can then be used in an experiment's
  run-config to replace the default time-initialised java.util.Random.

  Example: (rand-fn nextDouble (Random. 123))
  Becomes: (let [rng (Random. 123)] (fn [] (. rng nextDouble))

  Also useful, for easily creating several seeded PRNG-fns for a threaded
  experiment: (map #(rand-fn nextDouble (Random. %)) [1234 8472 9000])."
