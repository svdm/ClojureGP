ClojureGP
=========

ClojureGP is a genetic programming framework written in Clojure. It aims to be
highly configurable and versatile while still being concise and easy to learn.


Usage
-----

Please refer to the included documentation and examples in the `./doc/` and
`./examples/` directories. The docs are also available at <http://svdm.github.com/ClojureGP>.

To see a basic genetic programming run in action, load one of the example
experiments as follows, using a terminal/command prompt at the repository root:

    $ java -cp ./examples/;./src/;./lib/* clojure.main -i examples/reg_exp.clj --repl

Then call the `run` function from the Clojure REPL:

    Clojure 1.3.0
    user=> (reg-exp/run)

This same example experiment is discussed in `./doc/reg_example.html`.

*NOTE:* On Linux versions of the JVM, replace the ; in the classpath with : (so
 semicolons to colons).

Dependencies
------------

ClojureGP only *requires* Clojure 1.3.0. For additional features such as
plotting and improved random number generation, the QN Plot library and
Uncommons Maths library are needed.

Both Clojure and Uncommons Maths can be pulled in using Leiningen, via
`lein deps`.

QN Plot will have to be manually downloaded if you want to use the graphing
features. It can be found at the following locations:

 - <http://quies.net/java/math/plot/>
 - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/qn-plot/>
