  "Example 03: the traditional Artifical Ant on the Santa Fe trail experiment.

  The aim is to evolve a function that through repeated execution makes the ant
  walk the entirety of the trail, eating all pieces of food on it.

  Note that for this problem one should expect a fairly low probability of
  success. It is not an area that GP performs particularly well in, even
  compared to random search, but I include it here as it is quite well known and
  included as example in established toolkits such as ECJ [1] and lil-gp [2].
